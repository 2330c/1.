500 cities: This script examines asthma rates among adults aged 18 and older in 500 major U.S. cities.

by_state: This script analyzes ammonia and black carbon emissions data by state. It calculates per capita emissions, normalizes the data, and visualizes the relationship between ammonia and black carbon emissions per state. The script also identifies trends and calculates the correlation coefficient.

change_in_pollutant: This script tracks changes in PM2.5 pollutant levels over time.

PM25: This script analyzes the occurrence of the pollutant PM2.5 using the annual concentration by monitor and the state-level emissions data.

PM25_copy: This script normalizes PM2.5 emissions by state population and evaluates the correlation between these normalized emissions and average observed PM2.5 concentrations. The results are presented in a scatter plot.

urllib_3copy.py: This script extracts carbon dioxide emissions data for various countries, normalizes these emissions by the population of each country, and visualizes the relationship between population and emissions. It also provides graphs for each continent using a REPL and identifies the top and bottom 10 countries based on emissions per capita.

urllib3_emissions: This script downloads carbon dioxide emissions data from a CIA World Factbook page using urllib3, then uses BeautifulSoup to find and extract the emissions amount and year for each country from the HTML.
